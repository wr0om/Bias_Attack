    "# Let's start invastigating the biases in LLMs ! \n",

    "Here we will explain the steps of the project step by step, and runing the experiments on llama3 !\n",

    "### Intro\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing. However, they often inherit biases from their training data, leading to unfair outcomes. Detecting these biases, which is essential for developing LLMs in alignment with AI ethics guidelines, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of deep learning models and the vast scale of their training datasets. In this paper, we propose a method for bias evaluation in LLMs using thematic jailbreak prompts. By crafting prompts specifically designed to bypass model safeguards, we expose latent biases that remain hidden under standard interactions. Moreover, we discovered that the primary safeguard in LLMs—refusal alignment training—often acts as a superficial barrier, merely denying biases instead of addressing and mitigating them. Interestingly, when models do respond to bias-related questions, their explanations frequently reveal deeper layers of bias, providing valuable insights into how these biases are embedded within the model. Our approach offers a technique for uncovering and understanding these inherent biases in LLMs, contributing to the ongoing development of AI systems\n"
